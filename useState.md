## 1. What is useState?

`useState` is a React Hook that lets you **add state to functional components**.  
It returns a stateful value and a function to update it.

> In short: `useState` enables components to remember values between renders.

---

## 2. How useState Works & Rendering Impact

1. **Initial Render:** The initial state value is set.
2. **State Updates:** Calling the setter function updates the state and triggers a re-render.
3. **Rendering:**  
   - The component re-renders with the new state.
   - Only the component with the state re-renders, not its siblings.

## 3. Syntax and Common Patterns

### Basic Syntax

```jsx
const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue);
```

### Example: Counter

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Count: {count}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </>
  );
}
```

### Functional Updates

```jsx
setState(prevState => prevState + 1);
```

## 4. Real-World Applications

- **Form Inputs:** Manage input values and validation.
- **Toggles:** Show/hide UI elements.
- **Counters:** Track numeric values.
- **Local UI State:** Modal open/close, tab selection, etc.

---

## 5. Common Pitfalls & Fixes

- **State Not Updating Immediately:** State updates are asynchronous.
  - *Fix:* Use the updated value in a `useEffect` or callback.
- **Stale State in Closures:** Use functional updates to access the latest state.
- **Multiple State Updates:** React may batch updates; use functional updates if new state depends on previous state.

---

## 6. Performance Considerations

- Keep state as local as possible.
- Avoid storing derived values in state; compute them during render.
- For expensive initial state, use a function:  
  ```jsx
  const [value, setValue] = useState(() => computeExpensiveValue());
  ```

---

## 7. Best Practices

- Use separate state variables for unrelated data.
- Use objects or arrays for grouped state, but update immutably.
- Avoid unnecessary stateâ€”derive values when possible.
- Prefer functional updates when new state depends on previous state.
