# React Hooks 

React Hooks were introduced in **React 16.8** to let developers use **state** and other React features inside **functional components**. Before hooks, only **class components** could use state and lifecycle methods. Hooks make React code **simpler, reusable, and more powerful**.

## 🔹 What are React Hooks?

* React Hooks are **functions** that let you “hook into” React features like state and lifecycle.
* They allow us to write **functional components with state and side effects**.
* With hooks, we no longer need class components for most cases.

## 🔹 Basic Hooks

1. **[useState](./useState.md)** – Manages state inside functional components.
2. **[useEffect](./UseEffect.md)** – Handles side effects like data fetching, subscriptions, or timers.
3. **[useContext](./useContext.md)** – Consumes values from React Context without prop drilling.

## 🔹 Additional Hooks

4. **[useReducer](./useReducer.md)** – Manages complex state logic using a reducer function.
5. **[useMemo](./useMemo.md)** – Memoizes computed values to optimize performance.
6. **[useCallback](./useCallback.md)** – Memoizes computed function.
7. **[useRef](./useRef.md)** - Holds mutable values or DOM references without re-render.
8. **[useDebugValue](./useDebugValue.md)** -Displays debug info for custom hooks in DevTools.  
9. **[useDeferredValue](./useDeferredValue.md)** -Delays updating a value to keep UI responsive.
10. **[useID](./useID.md)** -Generates unique and stable IDs for accessibility and forms
